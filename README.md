# MeSHup
<b>A tool to visually browse co-occurrence of MeSH terms in PubMeb.</b>

Publications indexed in PubMed have human curated MeSH terms associated with them.
We leverage these MeSH terms and create a visual search tool to find articles in PubMed.
The idea is that a visual inspection of co-occurrences is helpful for exploratory queries to Pub Med.
